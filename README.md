Created for the [GitHub Game Off 2021](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2021). A survival game about a fly trying to survive after mysteriously being sucked into a phone. Tilt your phone to move the fly around to avoid colliding with the various shapes on screen.

This game features a minimalistic atmosphere and artwork, combined with originally composed/performed music.

Built using HTML, CSS, and JS on top of the [p5.js framework](https://p5js.org), as well as some p5.js plugins.
